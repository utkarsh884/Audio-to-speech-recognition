# Audio-to-Speech Recognition

A Jupyter Notebook-based project for experimenting with audio-to-speech recognition technologies.

## Overview

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate techniques and experiments for converting audio files into transcribed text using modern speech recognition models and libraries. The goal is to provide code examples, workflows, and insights for researchers, students, and developers interested in speech-to-text conversion.

## Features

- Load and process audio files
- Apply speech recognition models to convert audio to text
- Example notebooks for different datasets and models
- Modular, easy-to-extend code structure

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Recommended: Create a virtual environment

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/utkarsh884/Audio-to-speech-recognition.git
cd Audio-to-speech-recognition
```

Install dependencies (if `requirements.txt` is provided):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or, install dependencies as specified in the notebooks.

### Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab in the project directory:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Open and run the notebooks to explore audio-to-speech recognition workflows.
